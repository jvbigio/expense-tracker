# Expense Tracker

A simple expense tracker written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This application allows you to add expense data that has a spreadsheet layout. You can also remove expenses by clicking on the circle icon. More functionality coming soon!

# Summary

As a self-taught developer, I enjoy building applications and applying what I've learned and also learning subjects that are new to me. This application had a lot of fun little hurdles to tackle along the way. I plan to add functionality to this application in the near future, such as sorting data when the table header icons are clicked. Stay tuned for more!
